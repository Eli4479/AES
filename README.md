# AES Encryption/Decryption Project

A comprehensive full-stack web application implementing Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) encryption and decryption functionality, featuring a C++ core, a modern Next.js (TypeScript) frontend, and a Python FastAPI backend.

## Overview

With this application, you can quickly and securely encrypt or decrypt your data in real time using trusted, industry-standard AES algorithms. Whether you're just starting to explore the world of cryptography or looking to protect your sensitive information, our user-friendly interface makes the process simple and accessible for everyone. Enjoy learning, experimenting, and keeping your data safeâ€”all in one place!

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- Python 3.8 or higher
- C++ compiler (GCC or equivalent)
- Git


### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Eli4479/AES.git
cd AES
```

2. **Backend Setup**

```bash
cd backend
pip install fastapi uvicorn python-multipart cryptography
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

3. **Frontend Setup**

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```

4. **C++ Core Setup**

```bash
cd ../AES
g++ -o aes_encrypt main.cpp
./aes_encrypt
```


## Usage

### Web Interface

1. Navigate to the frontend application (typically `http://localhost:3000`)
2. Enter your text in the input field
3. Provide an encryption key (must be 16 characters or less for AES-128)
4. Click "Encrypt" to encrypt your data or "Decrypt" to decrypt previously encrypted data
5. View results in real-time

### API Endpoints

The FastAPI backend provides the following endpoints:

- `GET /` - Health check or welcome endpoint
- `POST /aes` - Handles both encryption and decryption based on request parameters
- `GET /docs` - Interactive API documentation



## AES Implementation Details

### Algorithm Specifications

The project implements the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) with the following specifications:

- **Block Size**: 128 bits (16 bytes)
- **Key Sizes**: 128 bits
- **Padding**: PKCS7 padding for data alignment


### Security Features

- **Strong Encryption**: Uses industry-standard AES algorithm with robust key management
- **Multiple Key Lengths**: Supports AES-128 for security requirements
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of keys, data, and parameters


## API Documentation

### Encryption Endpoint

```http
POST /aes
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "input": "Your plaintext/encrypted text here",
  "key": "your-encryption-key",
  "mode": "encrypt/decrypt"
}
```


### Response Format

```json
{
    "result": "Encrypted or decrypted text here",
    "status": "success"
}
```
